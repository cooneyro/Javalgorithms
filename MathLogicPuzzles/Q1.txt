Q:  You have 20 bottles of pills. 19 bottles have 1.0 gram pills, but one has pills of weight 1.1 grams. 
	Given a scale that provides an exact measurement, how would you find the heavy bottle? 
	You can only use the scale once.

A: bottle 1-19 = 1 gram pills
   bottle 20 = 1.1 gram pills

1 pill from bottle 1
2 pills from bottle 2
...
19 pills from bottle 19
20 pills from bottle 20

Total exptectedWeight = (1+2+3+4...+20) = 210;
Difference = actualWeight - expectedWeight;
AnswerIndex = difference/0.1 //each pills corresponds to increase

100 floor building
If egg drops from Nth floor or above, it breaks. 
Dropped from any floor below, doesn't break.
Given 2 eggs.
Find N, minimizing number of drops worst case.

floor 50
then go floor by floor
worst case = 50 total drops

floor 20
floor 40 
floor 60
floor 80
floor 100
worst case = 4 + 19 drops = 23

floor 10
floor 20
floor 30
floor 40
floor 50
...
floor 90
floor 100 worst case = 18

floor 10
floor 19
floor 28
floor 37
floor 46
floor 55
floor 64
floor 73
floor 82
floor 91
floor 100 worst case = 18

To load balance, each step should take same number of drops - x + (x-1) + (x-2) ... = 100
							      x(x+1)/2 = 100 , x = 14~
